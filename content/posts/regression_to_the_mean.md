Regression to the mean is the phenomenon where an extreme observation is likely
to be followed by one that is more average on further measurements. This is a
significant consideration in the design of experiments.

This is also an important mental model to keep when making estimations and
forecasts. For example, the best performing mutual fund in the past several
years is more likely to see a performance decline, than improve in the next
several years.

Only those that can consistently outperform the mean in some metric should be
considered "better" than the rest.
