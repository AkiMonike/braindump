## Dex-Net 2.0: Deep Learning to Plan Robust Grasps with Synthetic Point Clouds and Analytic Grasp Metrics {#mahler_dex-net_2017}

### We learn a function that takes as input a candidate grasp and a depth image and outputs an estimate of robustness {#we-learn-a-function-that-takes-as-input-a-candidate-grasp-and-a-depth-image-and-outputs-an-estimate-of-robustness}

DexNet is a function \\(f(\text{candidate grasp}, \text{depth image}) = P(\text{success})\\).
