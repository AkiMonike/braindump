The terminology of outside/inside view was coined by [Daniel Kahneman]({{< relref "daniel_kahneman" >}}) and Dan
Lovallo in 1993 ([Kahneman and Lovallo, n.d.](#orgee68c5f)), whose main claim is this:

> Decision makers are excessively prone to treat problems as unique, neglecting
> both the statistics of the past and the multiple opportunities in the future.

These are the result of two biases.

1.  The forecasts of future outcomes are anchored on plans and scenarios of
    success, rather than on past results, and are hence overly optimistic
2.  Evaluations of single risky prospects neglect the possibility of pooling
    risks

There are two distinct modes applied to forecasting. The _inside view_ of the
problem focuses on the case at hand, by considering the plans and obstacles to
its completion, and constructing scenarios of future progress. This is the mode
commonly adopted.

The _outside view_ ignores the details of the case at hand, and focuses on
statistics of cases similar to the present one.

When making a forecast, it is useful to consider the outside view first to
obtain a ball-park number. Then, use the insider view to adjust the previous
estimation up and down.
