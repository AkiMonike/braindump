PARA is a method of organizing digital information, designed by Tiago
Forte. Tiago Forte also proposed the method of [Progressive Summarization]({{<relref "progressive_summarization.md" >}}).

PARA stands for:

project
: a series of tasks linked to a goal. E.g. app mockups,
project plans, blog post etc.

areas
: a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over
time. E.g. Health, Finances, Travel, Hobbies

resources
: a topic or theme of ongoing interest. E.g. habit
formation, project management, interior design

## Projects vs Areas {#projects-vs-areas}

Projects always have a goal to be achieved, typically with some hard
deadline. The end of a project is signalled by the occurrence of some
discrete event.

Areas are ongoing standards, that may have no end date or eventual
outcome. **Projects always fall into areas**.

## Why distinguishing projects and areas is important {#why-distinguishing-projects-and-areas-is-important}

This helps someone **understand the true extent of their commitments**.
Commitments are towards projects -- responsibilities with tangible
outcomes. Knowing how projects connect to your long-term goals (areas)
is important.

## Contrasting with [Zettelkasten]({{<relref "zettelkasten.md" >}}) {#contrasting-with-zettelkasten--zettelkasten-dot-md}

This seems to be in contrast with other techniques like [Zettelkasten]({{<relref "zettelkasten.md" >}}).
which propose no such organization, instead using links between
different information.

My personal thoughts:

1.  PARA looks like it would form a good hierarchical overview of tasks
    and information. Zettelkasten does not provide this.
2.  Zettelkasten remains a useful tool for low-level,
    inter-project information-linking.
