[Reinforcement Learning ⭐]({{<relref "reinforcement_learning.md" >}}) is similar to how humans learn:

- Learning by trial-and-error
- Reward is often delayed

TD errors ([Temporal Difference Learning]({{<relref "td_learning.md" >}})) model the activity of
dopamine neurons ([Schultz, Dayan, and Montague, n.d.](#orgac44cd9))
