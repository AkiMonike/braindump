## General recommendations {#general-recommendations}

1.  Invest in ETFs, not single stocks ([Investing In ETFs]({{<relref "investing_in_etfs.md" >}}))
2.  Invest "110 minus your age" into stocks, and the rest into bonds
3.  For the stock component, half should be in local-stock ETF and half
    in global stock ETF
    1.  Global stock ETF is inherently more volatile, affected by
        currency
4.  The bond component should be entirely local
