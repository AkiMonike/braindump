Introduced by Howard Marks in 1991, the mood swings of the securities markets
resemble the movement of a pendulum:

-   While the midpoint describes the location of the pendulum on average, it
    spends little time in the middle
-   Swinging too far from the middle will result in an inevitable movement in the
    other direction, often far towards the other extreme ([Regression to the Mean]({{<relref "regression_to_the_mean.md#" >}})

)

Investor psychology often swings quickly between euphoria and depression. The
same goes for securities prices (being overpriced and underpriced).
