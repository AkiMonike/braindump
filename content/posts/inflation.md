-   When the demand of goods increases relative to the supply, there can be "demand-pull" inflation.
-   When inputs to production such as labour and raw materials increase, there can be "cost-push" inflation.
-   When the value of an importing country's currency declines relative to that of
    an exporting country, the cost of the exporter's goods can rise in the
    importing country
