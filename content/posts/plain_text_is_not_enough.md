Having lived within Emacs for a while, using [Org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/), I'm starting to think
that building a memex entirely supported by the plain-text format is impossible.
The internet is full of multimedia content, and we need a reliable way to refer
and annotate this content, all with plain-text.
