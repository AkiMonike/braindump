## Introduction {#introduction}

Despite the advances in research in computer vision, the dream of
having a computer interpret an image at the same level of a human is
still far away. Computer vision is inherently a difficult problem, for
many reasons. First, it is an _inverse problem_, in which we seek to
recover some unknowns given insufficient information to specify the
solution. Hence, we resort to physics-based and probabilistic models
to disambiguate between potential solutions.

Forward models that we use in computer vision are usually grounded in
physics and computer graphics. Both these fields model how objects
move and animate, how light reflects off their surfaces, is scattered
by the atmosphere, refracted through camera lenses and finally
projected onto a flat image plane.

In computer vision, we want to describe the world that we see in one
or more images and to reconstruct its properties, such as shape,
illumination and colour distributions. Some examples of computer vision
being used in real-world applications include Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) , machine inspection, retail, medical imaging, and
automotive safety.

In many applications, it is better to think back from the problem at
hand to suitable techniques, typical of an engineering approach. A
heavy emphasis will be placed on algorithms that are robust to noise,
and are reasonably efficient.

The above figure shows a rough layout of the content of computer
vision, and we see that from top to bottom, there are increasing
levels of modeling and abstraction.

## Image Formation {#image-formation}

### Geometric Primitives {#geometric-primitives}

Geometric primitives form the basic building blocks used to describe
three-dimensional shapes.

2D points can be denoted using a pair of values, \\(x = (x, y) \in
\mathbb{R}^2\\):

\begin{equation}
x = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\\\\\
y
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

2D points can also be represented using homogeneous coordinates,
\\(\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = (\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{w}) \in \mathbb{P}^2\\), where vectors
that differ only by scale are considered to be equivalent.
\\(\mathbb{P}^2 = \mathbb{R}^3 - (0, 0, 0)\\) is called the _2D projective
space_.

A homogeneous vector \\(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\\) can be converted back into an
in-homogeneous vector \\(\mathbf{x}\\) by diving through the last element
\\(\tilde{w}\\).

2D lines can be represented using homogeneous coordinates
\\(\tilde{\mathbf{l}} = (a, b, c)\\). The corresponding line equation is:

\begin{equation}
\bar{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{l}} = ax + by + c = 0
\end{equation}

The line equation vector can be normalized so that \\(\mathbf{l} =
(\hat{n}\_x, \hat{n}\_y, d) = (\hat{\mathbf{n}}, d)\\)
with \\(\lvert
\hat{\mathbf{n}} \rvert = 1\\). When using homogeneous coordinates, we
can compute the intersection of two lines as

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = \tilde{\mathbf{l}}\_1 \times \tilde{\mathbf{l}}\_2
\end{equation}

Similarly, the line joining two points can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{l}} = \tilde{\mathbf{x}}\_1 \times \tilde{\mathbf{x}}\_2
\end{equation}

Conic sections (which arise from the intersection of a plane and a 3d
cone) can be written using a quadric equation

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^T\mathbf{Q}\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = 0
\end{equation}

3D points can be written using in-homogeneous coordinates \\(\mathbf{x} =
(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\\), or homogeneous coordinates \\(\tilde{\mathbf{x}} =
(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{z}, \tilde{w}) \in \mathbb{P}^3\\).

3D planes can be represented as homogeneous coordinates \\(\tilde{\mathbf{m}}
= (a, b, c, d)\\) with the equation:

\begin{equation}
\bar{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{m}} = ax + by + cz + d = 0
\end{equation}

3D lines can be represented using 2 points on the line \\((\mathbf{p},
\mathbf{q})\\). Any other point on the line can be expressed as a linear
combination of these 2 points.

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{r} = (1 - \lambda)\mathbf{p} + \lambda \mathbf{q}
\end{equation}

### 2D Transformations {#2d-transformations}

The basic primitives introduced above can be transformed, the simplest
of which occur in the 2D plane.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-08-19_13-49-15.png" >}}

2D translations can be written as \\(\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{x} +
\mathbf{t}\\), or:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}' &= \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{t}
\end{bmatrix}\bar{\mathbf{x}} \\\\\\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{I} & \mathbf{t} \\\\\\
\mathbf{0}^T & 1
\end{bmatrix}\bar{\mathbf{x}}
\end{align}

where \\(\mathbf{0}\\) is the zero vector.

The combination of rotation and translation is known as 2D _rigid body
motion_, or the 2D Euclidean transformation, since Euclidean distances
are preserved. It can be written as \\(\mathbf{x}' =
\mathbf{R}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{t}\\) or:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}' = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{R} & \mathbf{t}
\end{bmatrix}\bar{\mathbf{x}}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & - \sin \theta \\\\\\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

is an orthonormal rotation matrix with
\\(\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}^T=\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\lVert R \rVert = 1\\).

The **similarity transform**, or scaled rotation, can be expressed as
\\(\mathbf{x}' = s\mathbf{R}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{t}\\). This preserves
angles between lines.

The **affine transformation** is written as \\(\mathbf{x}' =
\mathbf{A}\hat{\mathbf{x}}\\), where \\(\mathbf{A}\\) is an arbitrary \\(2 \times
3\\) matrix.

Parallel lines remain parallel under affine transformations.

Affine transformations with 6 unknowns can be solved via SVD by
forming a matrix equation of the form \\(Mx = b\\). Local transformations
apply different transformations to different regions, and give finer control.

The **projective transformation**, also known as the perspective transform
or homography, operates on homogeneous coordinates:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{x}}' = \tilde{\mathbf{H}}\tilde{\mathbf{x}}
\end{equation}

where \\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}\\) is an arbitrary \\(3 \times 3\\) matrix. Note that
\\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}\\) is homogeneous.

Each of these transformation preserves some properties, and can be
presented in a hierarchy.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-08-19_14-02-51.png" >}}

Some transformations that cannot be classified so easily include:

1.  Stretching and Squashing
2.  Planar surface flow
3.  Bilinear interpolant

The set of 3D transformations are similar to the 2D
transformations.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-08-19_14-05-15.png" >}}

### 3D Rotations {#3d-rotations}

The biggest difference between 2D and 3D coordinate transformations is
that the parameterization of the 3D rotation matrix \\(\mathbf{R}\\) is
not as straightforward.

#### Euler Angles {#euler-angles}

A rotation matrix can be formed as the product of three rotations
around three cardinal axes, e.g. \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). This is generally
a bad idea, because the result depends on the order of
transformations, and it is not always possible to move smoothly in a
parameter space.

#### Axis/angle (exponential twist) {#axis-angle--exponential-twist}

A rotation can be represented by a rotation axis \\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\\)
and an angle \\(\theta\\), or equivalently by a 3D vector \\(\mathbf{\omega} =
\theta\hat{\mathbf{n}}\\). We can write the rotation matrix corresponding to
a rotation by \\(\theta\\) around an axis \\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\\) as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R}(\hat{\mathbf{n}}, \theta) = \mathbf{I} + \sin \theta
[\hat{\mathbf{n}}]\_\times + \left(1-\cos\theta\right)[\hat{\mathbf{n}}]^2\_\times
\end{equation}

Also known as _Rodriguez's formula_.

For small rotations, this is an excellent choice, as it simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{\omega}) \approx \mathbf{I} + \sin\theta[\hat{\mathbf{n}}]\_\times = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -\omega_x & -\omega_y \\\\\\
\omega_z & 1 & -\omega_x \\\\\\
-\omega_y & \omega_x & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

This gives a nice linearized relationship between the rotation
parameters \\(\omega\\) and \\(\mathbf{R}\\). We can also compute the derivative
of \\(\mathbf{R}v\\) with respect to \\(\omega\\),

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{R}v}{\partial \omega^T} = -[\mathbf{v}]\_\times = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & z & -y \\\\\\
-z & 0 & x \\\\\\
y & -x & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

#### Unit Quarternions {#unit-quarternions}

<https://eater.net/quaternions>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg>

A unit quarternion is a unit length 4-vector whose components can be
written as \\(\mathbf{q} = (x, y, z, w)\\). Unit quarternions live on the
unit sphere \\(\lVert q \rVert = 1\\) and antipodal quartenions, \\(q\\) and
\\(-q\\) represent the same rotation. This representation is continuous
and are very popular representations for pose and for pose
interpolation.

Quarternions can be derived from the axis/angle representation through
the formula:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{q} = (\mathbf{v}, w) = \left(\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\hat{\mathbf{n}}, \cos\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\end{equation}

where \\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\\) and \\(\theta\\) are the rotation axis and angle.
Rodriguez's formula can be converted to:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R}(\hat{\mathbf{n}}, \theta) = \mathbf{I} + 2w[\mathbf{v}]\_\times + 2[\mathbf{v}]^2\_\times
\end{equation}

The nicest aspect of unit quarternions is that there is a simple
algebra for composing rotations expressed as unit quartenions:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{q}\_2 = \mathbf{q}\_0 \mathbf{q}\_1 = (\mathbf{v}\_0 \times \mathbf{v}\_1 + w_0 \mathbf{v}\_1 + w_1 \mathbf{v}\_0, w_0 w_1 - \mathbf{v}\_0 \cdot \mathbf{v}\_1)
\end{equation}

The inverse of a quarternion is just flipping the sign of \\(\mathbf{v}\\)
or \\(w\\), but not both. Then quarternion division can be defined as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{q}\_2 = \mathbf{q}\_0 / \mathbf{q}\_1 = (\mathbf{v}\_0 \times \mathbf{v}\_1 + w_0 \mathbf{v}\_1 - w_1 \mathbf{v}\_0, - w_0 w_1 - \mathbf{v}\_0 \cdot \mathbf{v}\_1)
\end{equation}

### 3D to 2D projections {#3d-to-2d-projections}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-08-20_17-35-43.png" >}}

We need to specify how 3D primitives are projected onto the image
plane. The simplest model is orthography, which requires no division
to get the final (in-homogeneous) result. The more commonly used model
is perspective, since this more accurately models the behavior of
real cameras.

#### Orthography {#orthography}

An orthographic projection simply drops the \\(z\\) component of the
three-dimensional coordinate \\(\mathbf{p}\\) to obtain the 2D point
\\(\mathbf{x}\\).

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} = \left[\mathbf{I}\_{2\times 2} | \mathbf{0} \right] \mathbf{p}
\end{equation}

In practice, world coordinates need to be scaled to fit onto an image
sensor, for this reason, _scaled orthography_ is actually more commonly
used:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} = \left[s\mathbf{I}\_{2 \times 2}\right | \mathbf{0}]\mathbf{p}
\end{equation}

This model is equivalent to first projecting the world points onto a
local fronto-parallel image plane, and then scaling this image using
regular perspective projection.

A closely related model is called _para-perspective_, which projects the
object points onto a local reference plane parallel to the image
plane. However, rather than being projected orthogonally to this
plane, they are projected parallel to the line of sight to the object
center. This is followed by the usual projection onto the final image
plane, and the combination of these two projections is affine.

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = \begin{bmatrix}
a\_{00} & a\_{01} & a\_{02} & a\_{03} \\\\\\
a\_{10} & a\_{11} & a\_{12} & a\_{13} \\\\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\tilde{\mathbf{p}}
\end{equation}

#### Perspective {#perspective}

Points are projected onto the image plane by dividing them by their
\\(z\\) component. Using homogeneous coordinates, this can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathcal{P}\_z(\mathbf{p}) = \begin{bmatrix}
x / z \\\\\\
y / z \\\\\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

In homogeneous coordinates, the projection has a simple linear form,

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\
\end{bmatrix}\tilde{\mathbf{p}}
\end{equation}

we drop the \\(w\\) component of \\(\mathbf{p}\\). Thus after projection, we
are unable to recover the distance of the 3D point from the image.

#### Camera Instrinsics {#camera-instrinsics}

Once we have projected a 3D point through an ideal pinhole using a
projection matrix, we must still transform the resulting coordinates
according to the pixel sensor spacing and the relative position of the
sensor plane to the origin.

Image sensors return _pixel values_ indexed by integer pixel coordinates
\\((x_s, y_s)\\). To map pixel centers to 3D coordinates, we first scale he
\\((x_s, y_s)\\) values by the pixel spacings \\((s_x, s_y)\\), and then describe
the orientation of the sensor array relative to the camera projection
center \\(\mathbf{O}\_c\\) with an origin \\(\mathbf{c}\_s\\) and a 3D rotation
\\(\mathbf{R}\_s\\).

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p} = \left[\mathbf{R}\_s | \mathbf{c}\_s \right] \begin{bmatrix}
s_x & 0 & 0 \\\\\\
0 & s_y & 0 \\\\\\
0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x_s \\\\\\
y_s \\\\\\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{M}\_s \hat{\mathbf{x}}\_s
\end{equation}

The first 2 columns of the \\(3 \times 3\\) matrix \\(\mathbf{M}\_s\\) are the 3D vectors
corresponding to the unit steps in the image pixel array along the
\\(x_s\\) and \\(y_s\\) directions, while the third column is the 3D image array
origin \\(\mathbf{c}\_s\\).

The matrix \\(\mathbf{M}\_s\\) is parameterized by 8 unknowns, and that
makes estimating the camera model impractical, even though there are
really only 7 degrees of freedom. Most practitioners assume a general
\\(3 \times 3\\) homogeneous matrix form.

#### Lens distortion {#lens-distortion}

Thus far, it has been assumed that the cameras obey a linear
projection model. In reality, many wide-angled lens suffer heavily
from radial distortion, which manifests itself as a visible curvature
in the projection of straight lines. Fortunately, compensating for
radial distortion is not that difficult in practice. The radial
distortion model says that the coordinates in the observed images are
displaced away (barrel distortion) or towards (pincushion distortion)
the image center by an amount proportional to their radial distance.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-08-20_18-17-31.png" >}}

#### Camera Calibration {#camera-calibration}

We want to use the camera to tell us things about the world, so we
need the relationship between coordinates in the world, and
coordinates in the image.

Geometric camera calibration is composed of:

extrinsic parameters (camera pose)
: from some arbitrary world
coordinate system to the camera's 3D coordinate system

intrinsic parameters
: From the 3D coordinates in the camera frame
to the 2D image plane via projection

<!--list-separator-->

- Extrinsic Parameters

  The transform \\(T\\) is a transform that goes from the world to the
  camera system.

   <!--list-separator-->

  - Translation

    The coordinate \\(P\\) in \\(B\\)'s frame is the coordinate \\(P\\) in frame \\(A\\),
    and the location of the camera in frame \\(B\\).

    \begin{equation}
    ^B P = ^A P + ^B O_A
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B P \\\\\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    I\_{3\times3} & ^B O_A \\\\\\
    0^T & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    ^A P \\\\\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

   <!--list-separator-->

  - Rotation

    We can similarly describe a rotation matrix:

    \begin{equation}
    ^B P = ^B \_A R ^AP
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    ^B_A R = \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B i_A & ^B j_A & ^B k_A
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    ^Ai_B^T \\\\\\
    ^Aj_B^T \\\\\\
    ^Ak_B^T
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    Under homogeneous coordinates, rotation can also be expressed as a
    matrix multiplication.

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B P \\\\\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B_AR & 0 \\\\\\
    0^T & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    ^A P \\\\\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    Then, we can express rigid transformations as:

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B P \\\\\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & ^BO_A \\\\\\
    0^T & 1 \\\\\\
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B_AR & 0 \\\\\\
    0^T & 1 \\\\\\
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    ^A P \\\\\\
    1
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B_AR & ^BO_A \\\\\\
    0^T & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
    ^A P \\\\\\
    1
    \end{equation}

    And we write:

    \begin{equation}
    ^B_A T = \begin{bmatrix}
    ^B_AR & ^BO_A \\\\\\
    0^T & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-11-24_13-05-41.png" >}}

    The world to camera transformation matrix is the extrinsic parameter
    matrix (4x4).

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-11-24_13-10-13.png" >}}

    The rotation matrix \\(R\\) has two important properties:

    1.  \\(R\\) is orthonormal: \\(R^T R = I\\)
    2.  \\(|R| = 1\\)

    One can represent rotation using Euler angles:

    pitch (\\(\omega\\))
    : rotation about x-axis

    yaw (\\(\phi\\))
    : rotation about y-axis

    roll (\\(\kappa\\))
    : rotation about z-axis

    Euler angles can be converted to rotation matrix:

    \begin{align}
    R &= R_x R_y R_z
    \end{align}

    Rotations can also be specified as a right-handed rotation by an angle
    \\(\theta\\) about the axis specified by the unit vector \\(\left(\omega_x,
    \omega_y, \omega_z \right)\\).

    This has the same disadvantage as the Euler angle representation,
    where algorithms are not numerically well-conditioned. Hence, the
    preferred way is to use [quarternions](#unit-quarternions). Rotations are represented with
    unit quarternions.

<!--list-separator-->

- Intrinsic Parameters

  We have looked at perspective projection, and we obtain the ideal
  coordinates:

  \begin{align}
  u &= f \frac{X}{Z} \\\\\\
  v &= f \frac{Y}{Z}
  \end{align}

  However, pixels are arbitrary spatial units, so we introduce an alpha
  to scale the value.

  \begin{align}
  u &= \alpha \frac{X}{Z} \\\\\\
  v &= \alpha \frac{Y}{Z}
  \end{align}

  However, pixels may not necessarily be square, so we have to introduce
  a different parameter for \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).

  \begin{align}
  u &= \alpha \frac{X}{Z} \\\\\\
  v &= \beta \frac{Y}{Z}
  \end{align}

  We don't know the origin of our camera pixel coordinates, so we have
  to add offsets:

  \begin{align}
  u &= \alpha \frac{X}{Z} + u_0 \\\\\\
  v &= \beta \frac{Y}{Z} + v_0
  \end{align}

  We also assume here that \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are perpendicular. To correct for
  this, we need to introduce skew coefficients:

  \begin{align}
  u &= \alpha \frac{X}{Z} - \alpha \cot \theta \frac{Y}{Z} + u_0 \\\\\\
  v &= \frac{\beta}{\sin \theta} \frac{Y}{Z} + v_0
  \end{align}

  We can simplify this by expressing it in homogeneous coordinates:

  {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-11-24_13-18-11.png" >}}

  The 3x4 matrix is the intrinsic matrix.

  This can be represented in an easier way:

  {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-11-24_13-20-19.png" >}}

  And if we assume:

  - pixels are square
  - there is no skew
  - and the optical center is in the center, then \\(K\\) reduces to

  \begin{equation}
  K = \begin{bmatrix}
  f & 0 & 0 \\\\\\
  0 & f & 0 \\\\\\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \end{equation}

### Photometric image formation {#photometric-image-formation}

Images are not composed of 2D features, but of discrete colour or
intensity values. Where do these values come from, and how do they
relate to the lighting in the environment, surface properties and
geometry, camera optics and sensor properties?

#### Lighting {#lighting}

To produce an image, a scene must be illuminated with one or more
light sources.

A point light source originates at a single location in space. In
addition to its location, a point light source has an intensity and a
colour spectrum (a distribution over wavelengths).

An area light source with a diffuser can be modeled as a finite
rectangular area emitting light equally in all directions. When the
distribution is strongly directional, a four-dimensional lightfield
can be used instead.

#### Reflectance and shading {#reflectance-and-shading}

When light hits an object surface, it is scattered and reflected. We
look at some more specialized models, including the diffuse, specular
and Phong shading models.

<!--list-separator-->

- The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)

  Relative to some local coordinate frame on the surface, the BRDF is a
  four-dimensional function that describes how much of each wavelength
  arriving at an incident direction \\(\hat{\mathbf{v}}\_i\\) is emitted in a
  reflected direction \\(\hat{\mathbf{v}}\_r\\). The function can be written
  in terms of the angles of the incident and reflected directions
  relative to the surface frame as \\(f_r(\theta_i, \phi_i, \theta_r,
  \phi_r;\lambda)\\).

  BRDFs for a given surface can be obtained through physical modeling,
  heuristic modeling or empirical observation. Typical BRDFs can be
  split into their diffuse and specular components.

<!--list-separator-->

- Diffuse Reflection

  The diffuse component scatters light uniformly in all directions and
  is the phenomenon we most normally associate with shading. Diffuse
  reflection also often imparts a strong body colour to the light.

  When light is scattered uniformly in all directions, the BRDF is
  constant:

  \begin{equation}
  f_d(\hat{\mathbf{v}}\_i, \mathbf{v}}\_r, \mathbf{n}};\lambda) = f_d(\lambda)
  \end{equation}

  and the amount of light depends on the angle between the incident
  light direction and the surface normal \\(\theta_i\\).

<!--list-separator-->

- Specular Reflection

  The specular reflection component heavily depends on the direction of
  the outgoing light. Incident light rays are reflected in a direction
  that is rotated by 180^&deg; around the surface normal
  \\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\\).

  {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-08-21_11-16-05.png" >}}

<!--list-separator-->

- Phong Shading

  Phong combined the diffuse and specular components of reflection with
  another term, which he called the ambient illumination. This term
  accounts for the fact that objects are generally illuminated not only
  by point light sources but also by a general diffuse illumination
  corresponding to inter-reflection or distance sources. In the Phong
  model, the ambient term does not depend on surface orientation, but
  depends on the colour of both the ambient illumination \\(L_a(\lambda)\\)
  and the object \\(k_a(\lambda)\\),

  \begin{equation}
  f_a(\lambda) = k_a(\lambda) L_a(\lambda)
  \end{equation}

  The Phong shading model can then be fully specified as:

  \begin{equation}
  L_r(\hat{\mathbf{v}}\_r ; \lambda) = k_a(\lambda) L_a(\lambda)

  - k_d(\lambda) \sum_i L_i(\lambda) [\hat{\mathbf{v}}\_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}]^+
  - k_s(\lambda) \sum_i L_i(\lambda) (\hat{\mathbf{v}}\_r \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}\_i)^{k_e}
    \end{equation}

  The Phong model has been superseded by other models in terms of
  physical accuracy. These models include the di-chromatic reflection
  model.

<!--list-separator-->

- Optics

  Once the light from a scene reaches a camera, it must still pass
  through the lens before reaching the sensor.

## Image Processing {#image-processing}

### Point Operators {#point-operators}

Point operators are image processing transforms where each output
pixel's value depends only on the corresponding input pixel value.
Examples of such operators include:

- brightness and contrast adjustments
- colour correction and transformations

### Image Enhancement {#image-enhancement}

#### Histogram Equalization {#histogram-equalization}

<https://www.math.uci.edu/icamp/courses/math77c/demos/hist%5Feq.pdf>

The underlying math behind histogram equalization involves mapping one
distribution (the given histogram of intensity values) to another
distribution (a wider and, ideally, uniform distribution of intensity
values).

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-08-30_16-43-39.png" >}}

We may use the cumulative distribution function to remap the original
distribution as an equally spread distribution simply by looking up
each y-value in the original distribution and seeing where it should
go in the equalized distribution.

\begin{equation}
g\_{i,j} = \left\lfloor \left( L - 1 \right) \sum\_{n = 0}^{f\_{i,j}}
p_n \right\rfloor
\end{equation}

#### Convolutions {#convolutions}

Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its
local neighbors, weighted by the kernel.

Convolutions can be used to denoise, descratch, blur, unblur and even
feature extraction.

Median filtering is good for removing salt-and-pepper noise, or
scratches in image

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-11-23_10-05-43.png" >}}

### Color {#color}

A human retina has 2 kinds of light receptors: rods are sensitive to
amount of light, while cones are sensitive to wavelengths of light

There are 3 kinds of cones:

short
: most sensitive to blue

medium
: most sensitive to green

long
: most sensitive to red

Cones send signals to the brain, and the brain interprets this mixture
of signals as colours. This gives rise to the RGB colour coding
scheme. Different coding schemes have different colour spaces.

Cones are sensitive to various colours, ranging from wavelengths of
400nm (violet) to 700nm (red).

There are some regions that extend beyond the visible region, but are
still relevant to image processing:

- 0.7-1.0\\(\mu m\\): Near infrared (NIR)
- 1.0-3.0\\(\mu m\\): Short-wave infrared (SWIR)
- 3.0-5.0\\(\mu m\\): Mid-wave infrared (MWIR)
- 8.0-12.0\\(\mu m\\): Long-wave infrared (LWIR)
- 12.0-1000.0\\(\mu m\\): Far infrared or very long-wave infrared (VLWIR)

The range 5-8\\(\mu m\\) corresponds to a wavelength spectrum that is
largely absorbed by the water in the atmosphere.

**Color constancy** is the ability of the human visual system to be immune
to changing illumination in perception of colour. The human colour
receptors perceive the overall effect of the mixture of colours, and
cannot tell its composition.

**Gamut** is the range of colours that can be reproduced with a given
colour reproduction system.

In the RGB colour space, each value is an unsigned 8-bit value from
0-255.

In the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) colour space, hue corresponds to
colour type from 0 (red) to 360. Saturation corresponds to the
colourfulness (0 - 1 full colour), while value refers to the
brightness (0 black - 1 white).

The YCbCRr Colour space is used for TV and video. Y stands for
luminance, Cb blue difference, and Cr red difference.

There are several colour conversion algorithms to convert values in
one colour space to another.

Primary colours are the set of colours combined to make a range of
colours. Since human vision is trichromatic, we only need to use 3
primary colours. The combination of primary colours can be additive or
subtractive.

Examples of additive combinations include overlapping projected lights
and CRT displays. RGB is commonly used in additive combinatinos.
Examples of subtracting combinations include mixing of color pigments
or dyes. The primary colours used in these cases are normally cyan,
magenta and yellow.

#### Measuring Colour Differences {#measuring-colour-differences}

The simplest metric is the euclidean distance between colours in the
RGB space:

\begin{equation}
d(C_1, C_2) = \sqrt{\left( R_1 - R_2 \right)^2 + \left( G_1 - G_2
\right)^2 + \left( B_1 - B_2 \right)^2}
\end{equation}

However, the RGB space is not perceptually uniform, and this is
inappropriate if one needs to match human perception. HSV, YCbCr are
also not perceptually uniform. Some colour spaces that are more
perceptually uniform are the Munsell, CIELAB and CIELUB colour spaces.

#### Computing Means {#computing-means}

The usual formula of computing means \\(M = \frac{1}{n}S =
\frac{1}{n}\sum\_{i=1}^n R_i\\) can lead to overflow even for small \\(n\\).
One way to get around it is to use a floating point representation for
\\(S\\). The second method is to do incremental averaging:

\begin{equation}
M_k = \frac{k-1}{k}M\_{k-1} + \frac{1}{k}R_k
\end{equation}

#### Digital Cameras sensing colour {#digital-cameras-sensing-colour}

[Bayer filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer%5Ffilter)

## Change Detection {#change-detection}

Detecting change between 2 video frames is straightforward -- compute
the differences in pixel intensities across the two frames:

\begin{equation}
D_t(x, y) = | I(x,y,t+1) - I(x,y,t)|
\end{equation}

It is common to use a threshold for \\(D_t(x,y)\\) to declare if a pixel
has changed.

To detect positional changes, the method used must be immune to
illumination change. This requires motion tracking.

At the same time, to detect illumination change, the method must be
immune to positional change. In the case of a stationary scene and
camera, the straightforward method can be used. However, in the non
trivial case, motion tracking will be required.

## Motion Tracking {#motion-tracking}

There are two approaches to motion tracking: feature-based and
intensity-gradient based.

### Feature-based {#feature-based}

Feature-based motion tracking utilises distinct features that changes
positions. For each feature, we search for the matching feature in the
next frame, to check if there is a displacement.

Good features are called "corners". The two popular corner detectors
are the Harris corner detector and the Tomasi corner detector.

Although corners are only a small percentage of the image, they
contain the most important features in restoring image information,
and they can be used to minimize the amount of processed data for
motion tracking, image stitching, building 2D mosaics, stereo vision,
image representation and other related computer vision areas.

#### [Harris corner detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris%5FCorner%5FDetector) {#harris-corner-detector}

Compared to the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi corner detector, the Harris corner
detector provides good repeatability under changing illumination and
rotation, and therefore, it is more often used in stereo matching and
image database retrieval.

Interpreting the eigenvalues:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-11-24_14-54-48.png" >}}

In flat regions, the eigenvalues are both small, in edges, only one of
the eigenvalues are large. On the other hand, in corners, both
eigenvalues are large but the 2 eigenvalues of the same magnitude, the error
\\(E\\) increases in all directions.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/screenshot_2018-11-24_14-56-43.png" >}}

The Harris corner response function essentially filters out the corners.

<!--list-separator-->

- Properties

  1.  Harris corner detector is invariant to rotation: Ellipse has the
      same eigenvalues regardless of rotation.
  2.  Mostly invariant to additive and multiplicative intensity changes
      (threshold issue for multiplicative)
  3.  Not invariant to image scale!

#### Tomasi corner detector {#tomasi-corner-detector}

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{N} \sum\_{u} \sum_v \begin{bmatrix}
I_x^2 & I_x I_y \\\\\\
I_x I_y & I_y^2 \\\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where \\(I_x = \frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\\), \\(N\\) is the total number
of pixels in window of interest, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are the horizontal and
vertical index of the pixel in the window of interest.

Let the eigenvalues of the above matrix be \\(\lambda\_{max}\\) and
\\(\lambda\_{min}\\). Then the greater \\(\lambda\_{min}\\), the more
"cornerness" the feature.

Examples of feature descriptors include SIFT and SURF. The typical
workflow involves:

1.  Detecting good features
2.  Building feature descriptors on each of these features
3.  Matching these descriptors on the second image to establish the
    corresponding points

### Gradient-based {#gradient-based}

Gradient-based motion tracking makes 2 basic assumptions:

1.  Intensity changes smoothly within image
2.  Pixel intensities of a given object does not change over time

Suppose that an object is in motion. Then the position of the object
is given by \\((dx, dy)\\) over time \\(dt\\). From the brightness constancy
assumption,

\begin{equation}
I(x + dx, y + yd, t + dt) = I(x,y,t)
\end{equation}

If we apply the Taylor series expansion on the left hand side, we get:

\begin{equation}
I(x + dx, y + dy, t + dt) = I(x,y,t) + \frac{\partial I}{\partial
x}dx + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y} dy + \frac{\partial
I}{\partial t}dt + \dots
\end{equation}

Omitting higher-order terms, we get

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial I}{\partial
x}dx + \frac{\partial I}{\partial y} dy + \frac{\partial
I}{\partial t}dt = 0
\end{equation}

We denote this as \\(I_x u + I_y v + I_t = 0\\), but this has 2 unknowns, and
is unsolvable.

#### Lucas-Kanade method {#lucas-kanade-method}

Suppose an object moves by displacement \\(\mathbb{d} = (dx, dy)^T\\). Then
\\(J(x+d) = I(x)\\), or \\(J(x) = I(x-d)\\).

Due to noise, there is some error at position \\(x\\):

\begin{equation}
e(x) = I(x - d) - J(x)
\end{equation}

We sum the errors over some window \\(W\\) at position \\(x\\):

\begin{equation}
E(x) = \sum\_{x \in W} w(x) \left[ I(x-d) - J(x) \right]^2
\end{equation}

If \\(E\\) is small, then the patterns in \\(I\\) and \\(J\\) match well. We find
the \\(d\\) that minimises \\(E\\). If we expand \\(I(x-d)\\) with Taylor
expansion:

\begin{equation}
I(x-dx, y-dy) = I(x,y) - dx I_x(x,y) - dy I_y (x,y) + \dots
\end{equation}

Then,

\begin{equation}
J(x) = I(x - d) = I(x) - d^T g(x), g(x) = \begin{bmatrix}
I_x(x) \\\\\\
I_y(x)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Where g(x) is the intensity gradient. Substituting the above equation,
and setting \\(\frac{\partial E}{\partial d} = 0\\):

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial d} = -2 \sum\_{x \in W} w(x) \left[ I(x) -
J(x) - d^T g(x) \right] g(x)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sum\_{x \in W} w(x)\left[ I(x) - J(x) \right] g(x) = \sum\_{x \in W}
w(x) g(x) g^T(x) d
\end{equation}

We denote this as:

\begin{equation}
Z d = b
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
Z = \begin{bmatrix}
\sum\_{x \in W} w I_x^2 & \sum\_{x \in W} w I_x I_y \\\\\\
\sum\_{x \in W} wI_x I_y & \sum\_{x \in W} w I_y^2
\end{bmatrix}, b = \begin{bmatrix}
\sum\_{x \in W} w(I-J)I_x \\\\\\
\sum\_{x \in W} w(I-J)I_y
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

With 2 unknowns and 2 equations, we can solve for \\(d\\).

Lucas-Kanade algorithm is often used with Harris/Tomasi's corner
detectors. First, corner detectors are applied to detect good
features, then LK method is applied to compute \\(d\\) for each pixel. \\(d\\)
is then accepted only for good features.

The math of LK tracker assumes \\(d\\) is small, and would only work for
small displacements. To handle large displacements, the image is
downsampled. Usually , the Gaussian filter is used to smoothen the
image before scaling down.

## Homography {#homography}

<https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d9/dab/tutorial%5Fhomography.html>

The planar homography relates the transformation between 2 planes, up
to a scale factor:

\begin{equation}
s \begin{bmatrix}
x' \\\\\\
y' \\\\\\
1
\end{bmatrix} =
H \begin{bmatrix}
x \\\\\\
y \\\\\\
1
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
h\_{11} & h\_{12} & h\_{13} \\\\\\
h\_{21} & h\_{22} & h\_{23} \\\\\\
h\_{31} & h\_{32} & h\_{33} \\\\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\\\\\
y \\\\\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The homography is a \\(3 \times 3\\) matrix with 8 degrees of freedom, as it is
estimated up to a scale.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/homography_perspective_correction_chessboard_matches_2018-10-19_11-08-50.jpg" >}}

Homographies are used in:

- camera pose estimation
- panorama stitching
- perspective removal/correction

## Structure For Motion {#structure-for-motion}

In general, a single image cannot provide 3D information. From a set
of images taken with varying camera positions, we can extract 3D
information of the scene. This requires us to match (associate)
features in one image with the same feature in another image.
