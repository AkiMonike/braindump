Roam research is a tool for networked-thought, created by [Conor
White-Sullivan]({{<relref "conor_white_sullivan.md" >}}). Roam adopts methods from [Zettelkasten]({{<relref "zettelkasten.md" >}}).

  - Basic Idea is to pull out related notes from other sources (books,
    articles etc.)
  - Group them up into common themes (e.g. "Ease is not the Goal")
  - Polish after pulling out relevant notes

  - Highly similar to the above Nat Eliason video.
  - He uses file-tag metadata as well, "in what context do I want to
