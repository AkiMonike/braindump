The three tenets of technical analyses are:


## Market action discounts everything {#market-action-discounts-everything}

Anything that can possibly affect the price is reflected in the price of the
market. Therefore all that is required is the study of price action.


## Prices move in trends {#prices-move-in-trends}

This is the market equivalent of Newton's first law: a trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse.


## History repeats itself {#history-repeats-itself}

Patterns that worked well in the past will continue to work well in the future.
