## Twitter Data Science Event {#twitter-data-science-event}


### Maya Hari, Twitter Managing Director APAC {#maya-hari-twitter-managing-director-apac}

> World's largest collection of human thought

Indonesia's flood relief effort empowered by geolocated tweets.

Half of the world's millennials will be in Asia by 2020. Asia is a
great canvas for solving and innovating on problems, making Asia an
engine for growth for Twitter.

Transliteration and languages are the next frontier of opportunity.

#### 140 character limit story {#140-character-limit-story}

-   2016: Timing wasn't right for going beyond 140
-   Email sent by a Japanese engineer (Iku) previously iOS engineer,
    now on machine learning team:
    -   From personal research project, Japanese characters need 140 characters, but English users need
        280-300 characters
    -   Japanese can contain about 1.9x more information than English in a
        character, visualized by separating tweets by language
    -   Japanese plain tweet length averages around 14 characters
    -   Tweet lengths fit a log-normal distribution: extending the
        log-normal distribution for english, 280 characters is the number found.
-   The 280 character project was born, customizing character limit
    based on the keyboard.
-   9% of tweets hit the 140 limit, 1% of the tweets hit the 280 limit
-   Post analysis of 280 project:
    -   Less abbreviations
    -   More kind words like "please", "thank you"
    -   Same tweet length
