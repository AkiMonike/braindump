Cross-modal hashing is the compression of high dimensional data into
compact binary codes with similar binary codes for similar objects.
The key ideas is to create codes for cross-modal retrieval. The
constraints are :

1.  It has to be an N-dimensional hamming space -- a binary
    representation with a controllable number of bits.
2.  The same object from different modalities has to have a similar
    hash code
3.  The space has to be similarity-preserving
