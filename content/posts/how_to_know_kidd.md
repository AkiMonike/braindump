Why are we curious about some things but not others? What are the core
cognitive systems that people use to guide their learning about the
world?

## 5 Key things in ML that we should know about humans {#5-key-things-in-ml-that-we-should-know-about-humans}

### Humans continuously form beliefs {#humans-continuously-form-beliefs}

Upon seeing a bowl, we update our belief about what a bowl is. This
also influences what we wish to sample next. Infants look away when
events are predictable, but also when they are surprising!

**When present data to learning algorithms, we should show data that is
at ideal region on the "surprising" spectrum.**

### Certainty diminishes interest {#certainty-diminishes-interest}

We are not curious about things that we already know. If we think we
know an answer, when presented with the objective truth, we are still
unlikely to change our beliefs.

### Certainty is driven by feedback {#certainty-is-driven-by-feedback}

When feedback isn't available, our estimates about our certainty may
not be accurate. When feedback is readily available, we can sometimes
be certain, when we should not be.

### Less feedback may encourage overconfidence {#less-feedback-may-encourage-overconfidence}

### Humans form beliefs quickly {#humans-form-beliefs-quickly}
