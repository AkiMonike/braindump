Minimizing context switching is one of the best ways to increase productivity.
I see this phenomenon occur in the systems I implement:

1.  [Getting Things Done (GTD)]({{<relref "getting_things_done.md#" >}}): Separating the cognitive process into individual
    tasks: e.g. capturing, processing, doing.
2.  In Emacs, context switching is minimized by doing everything within Emacs
    itself: writing code, writing notes, reading email. Using Org-mode as the
    glue has been extremely helpful.
3.  In building [srs.ly](https://github.com/jethrokuan/srs.ly), I consider the importance of ease of prompt creation.
    This reduces context switching: e.g. from reading the article to hopping over
    to Anki and creating flashcards.
