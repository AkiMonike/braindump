Trees are able to establish working relationships with fungi. In return for a
portion of their food production, fungi that attach to the roots of trees can
help disseminate crucial information and perform nutrient exchange between trees
in a forest. In many senses, the fungi act as the Internet for trees.

One interesting observation was that this behaviour was lesser seen in
plantations (seeded trees), since the trees are harvested soon after.

The large, extensive, forest-wide connection established has been coined as "the
Wood Wide Web".
