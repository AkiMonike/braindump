The real estate cycle is equally affected by investor psychology and economic
activity, but unlike the other cycles, it factors the following crucial
ingredients:

-   Real estate development takes a long time; supply is inflexible and cannot be
    easily adjusted with demand
-   There is extreme time lag between conception and readiness for sale

Investors can incur a greater risk here, but knowing their positioning in the
cycle can aid investors in making investment decisions.
