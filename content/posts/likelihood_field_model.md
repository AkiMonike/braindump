## Key Idea {#key-idea}

Project an individual sensor measurement \\(z_t^k\\) into the global
coordinate frame of map \\(m\\). Discards max-range readings.

Assumes three types of noise, similar to [Range Finder Model]({{<relref "range_finder_model.md" >}}):

1.  Measurement noise: Gaussian
2.  Failures: point-mass distribution at \\(z\_{\text{max}}\\)
3.  Random measurements: Uniform distribution \\(p\_{\text{rand}}\\)

The model is a mixture of these 3 densities:

\begin{equation}
z\_{\mathrm{hit}} \cdot p\_{\mathrm{hit}}+z\_{\mathrm{rand}} \cdot p\_{\mathrm{rand}}+z\_{\mathrm{max}} \cdot p\_{\mathrm{max}}
\end{equation}

## Issues {#issues}

1.  Does not explicitly model dynamic objects that cause short readings
2.  Treats sensors as being able to see through walls: ray casting
    replaced by nearest neighbour function: incapable of determining
    whether a path to a point is intercepted by an obstacle in the map
3.  Does not account for map uncertainty

These issues can be addressed via extensions to the algorithm.
