## How do people use visualization? {#how-do-people-use-visualization}

- verification
- analysis
- exploration/discovery
- presentation/storytelling
- art/aesthetics

## Provenance {#provenance}

The steps the user take in the process of visual exploration/analysis
and the resulting visualizations and findings

We use provenance for:

- recall
- reuse and replicate
- Sharing
- Meta-analysis

Capture:

- datasets
- visualization and insight
- interaction

## Visual Interaction Techniques {#visual-interaction-techniques}

- Selecting/Highlighting/Brushing
- Using Lasso to update linked views
- sidebars for interactive filtering

## A well-designed interactive visualization interface should show the following {#a-well-designed-interactive-visualization-interface-should-show-the-following}

Visualize
: use effective visual encodings

Filter
: reduce visible data to relevant items

Select
: Retrieve details about interesting items

Navigate
: Pan, zoom, change view

## Visual Design and Encoding - Westermann {#visual-design-and-encoding-westermann}

> The purpose of visualization is **insight**, not pictures. - Schneiderman

### Why use Interactivity? {#why-use-interactivity}

1.  Handle data complexity
2.  A single static view can show only one aspect of data

> Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand

### Why depend on vision? {#why-depend-on-vision}

1.  Visual system is high-bandwidth channel to brain

### Pre-attentive Processing {#pre-attentive-processing}

- Sequential vs. Parallel processing (popout)
- Combination of channels usually requires serial search
- Difficult if no unique visual property of the target

### Gestalt Principles {#gestalt-principles}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/th_2018-07-30_09-47-57.jpeg" >}}

Representations should be _correct_, _accurate_ and _truthful_.

To bring up a change, you must attend to it. (Change blindness)

### Visual Design {#visual-design}

A good visualization depends on:

1.  data types
2.  context of the data
3.  tasks to perform e.g. identify trends
4.  questions to answer
5.  messages to deliver

\begin{equation}
\text{Lie Factor} = \frac{\text{Size of effect shown in
graphic}}{\text{Size of effect in data}}
\end{equation}

Bad visualizations do not allow you to recover original data from the
visualization. Keep proportions and relative sizes.

maximize data-ink ratio

Steven's psychophysical power law:

\begin{equation}
\text{Perceived sensation} = \text{Physical Intensity}^T
\end{equation}

Compensating for human's over/underestimation:

Difficult to focus on one channel when multiple channels are
presented. (Redudancy is bad!)

## Scientific Data Visualization - Stefan Bruckner {#scientific-data-visualization-stefan-bruckner}

### Types of Visualization {#types-of-visualization}

1.  Volume Visualization
    - Visualization of scalar fields
    - Important in medicine, biology, geoscience, engineering, ...
2.  Flow Visualization
    - Visualization of Vector Fields
    - Data typically from computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
      simulations

### Data Representation {#data-representation}

- Inherent Spatial Domain?
  - Yes: Do we recycle data space or not
  - No: Select which representation space
- What dimension is used for what?
  - Relationship data space <=> data attributes
  - Available display space (2D/3D)
  - Where is the focus?
  - Where can you abstract?

### Grids {#grids}

- Common way of storing datasets of field type (scalar, vector, tensor
  fields)
- Typically a high-performance, space-efficient representation
- Data is organized in **cells** which contain **samples**.
- Often used to define an interpolation function that defines data
  values between samples leading to a **continuous representation**.

- Which data orginazation is optimal?
- Where does the data come from?
- Is there an explicit neighbourhood relationship?
- How is the neighborhood information stored?
- How is navigation within the data possible?
- Calculations within the data possible?
- Are the data structured?

#### Regular Grid {#regular-grid}

- Orthogonal, equidistant grid
- Sample distances not equal
- Implicit neighborhood-relationship

#### Rectilinear Grid {#rectilinear-grid}

- Orthogonal grid
- Varying sample distances (\\(x[i], y[j]\\) given)
- Allows you to place more samples in areas that are more important to
  you, not wasting storage in uninterested areas

#### Curvilinear Grid {#curvilinear-grid}

- Non-orthogonal grid
- Grid-points explicitly given (\\(x[i,j]\\))
- Implicit neighborhood relationship

#### Block-structured Grid {#block-structured-grid}

- Combination of structured grids

#### Unstructured Grid {#unstructured-grid}

- Grid-points and connections arbitrary
- Grid-points and neighborhood explicitly given
- Cells: tetrahedra

#### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Other Grids SUMMARY OF GRID TYPES {#other-grids-summary-of-grid-types}

- Non-cartesian Coordinates

#### Scattered Data {#scattered-data}

- Grid-free data

> Interesting to look at dimensionality of data space, vs dimensionality
> of data attributes

#### Data Enhancement {#data-enhancement}

- Filtering
- Resampling
- Data derivation
- Data interpolation

#### Data, Visualization, Interaction {#data-visualization-interaction}

- Coupling varies considerably
  - Data Generation (data acquisition)
    - Mesaurement, simulation, modelling
    - Can take very long, and be very costly
  - Visualization (rest of visualization pipeline)
    - Data enhancement, viz mapping, rendering
    - Depending on implementation, fast/slow
  - Interaction
    - How can the user intervene, vary parameters

#### Interactive Steering {#interactive-steering}

- Simulation and modelling generate data "on the fly"
- Allows real-time insight of the data
- User can interfere with the simulation, and change the design of the
  simulations

#### Volume Visualization {#volume-visualization}

- the visualization of 3D scalar fields
- Mapping 3D -> 2D
- Projection (e.g. MIP), slicing, volume rendering
- Volume data is 3Dx1D data
- Scalar data, 3D data space, space filling
- User wants to gain insight into 3D data, find structures of special
  interest + context

<!--list-separator-->

- Organization of Volume Data

  1.  Cartesian or Regular grid
      1.  CT/MR, often dx=dy<dz
      2.  Data enhancement: iso-stack-calculation
  2.  Curvilinear, unstructured grid

#### Challenges {#challenges}

- So much information, so few pixels
- How to identify and enhance relevant features in the data.
- Speed and interaction very important

#### Voxels vs Cells {#voxels-vs-cells}

- pixels = picture element, voxels = volume element
- A voxel is a point sample in 3D, not necessarily interpolated
- Cell is a cube primitive, and the corners are 8 voxels. Values in
  cell use interpolation.

#### Linear Interpolation {#linear-interpolation}

- Current GPUs automatically do trilinear interpolation of 3D textures

#### Evaluating Quality of Reconstruction {#evaluating-quality-of-reconstruction}

- Marshner-Lobb function is a common test signal to evaluate the
  quality of reconstruction filters
- Signal has a high amount of energy near its Nyquist frequency

#### Classification {#classification}

- Using data values, gradiant and curvature, segment data into
  multiple semantic regions
- Often semi-automatic or fully manual
- Automatic approximation: transfer functions
  - Simplest example of 1D transfer function: data value -> color

#### Visualization Approaches {#visualization-approaches}

Slicing
: display of 2D cross sections

Indirect Volume Rendering
: Extraction of an intermediate representation

Direct Volume Rendering
: Direct display of representation

#### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Isosurface Similarity {#isosurface-similarity}

#### Visualization in the Spatial Domain {#visualization-in-the-spatial-domain}

<!--list-separator-->

- Slicing

  - Reduce the dimensionality of 3D t o2D by showing a cross section
  - Usually without a transfer function
  - Orthogonal slicing often used to slice along anatomical planes
    in medical imagery
  - Oblique slicing has arbitrary slice orientation, often used in
    an multi-planar reformation (MPR) setup.
  - Curved slices often tailored towards specific applications,
    e.g. visualization of blood vessels.

<!--list-separator-->

- Direct Volume Rendering

  - Dense representation of underlying scalar field: transfer function
    defines visible structure.
  - Image order (ray casting) fast and easy to implement, and are well
    supported by current GPUs
  - Object order (splatting, texture slicing) also supported by older
    GPUs, but difficult to skip non-visible regions. Easy to skip...(?)
  - Nowadays: shading/classification after interpolation/resampling
  - post/pre-interpolative classification order

<!--list-separator-->

- Ray Tracing vs Ray Casting

  Ray tracing
  : method from image generation, usig ray-object
  intersection and tracing secondary rays.

  Ray casting
  : no objects, density values in 3D, only viewing rays.

<!--list-separator-->

- Shading

  lambertian reflection
  : light reflected equally in all directions

  specular reflection
  : light reflected more in one direction

  Make structures in volume data sets more realistic by applying an
  illumination model

  - Shade each sample in the volume like a surface: [Blinn-Phong
    illumination model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%25E2%2580%2593Phong%5Fshading%5Fmodel) commonly used.
  - Use normalized gradient vector as estimation for surface normal.

#### Indirect Volume Rendering {#indirect-volume-rendering}

- Extract an intermediate representation from the volume (geometric
  surface), then use traditional rendering methods
- Cuberille regards each xovel as a little cube, classify as either
  part of the object or not.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/th_2018-07-31_11-00-07.jpeg" >}}

[Marching Cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching%5Fcubes) is a standard method for the extraction of isosurfaces
from volume data

### Flow Visualization {#flow-visualization}

- Airplane/ship/car design
- Weather simulation
- Medicine (blood flows etc.)
- Gaseous, liquid flow
- Flow models: Differential Equation Systems (ODEs)
- Common techniques for solving Navier-Stokes equations:
  1.  Lagrangian approach (particle-based)
      1.  Treat the fluid as discrete particles, and apply interaction
          forces.
      2.  Pros: momentum conservation/more intuitive, and fast, no
          linear equation solving
      3.  Cons: connectivity information/surface reconstruction
  2.  Eulerian approach
      1.  Discretize the domain using finite differences
      2.  Use the operator splitting technique to solve each term separately
      3.  Pros: derivative approximation, adaptive time step/solver
      4.  Cons: memory usage & speed, grid artifact/resolution limitation.
