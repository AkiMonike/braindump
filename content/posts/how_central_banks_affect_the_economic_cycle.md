Central banks have two main responsibilities in the economy:

1.  Controlling inflation
2.  Controlling employment rates

These two responsibilities balance each other: when employment rates rise, the
economy grows stronger, resulting in inflation, and vice versa.

Central banks act counter-cyclicly to moderate inflation. To do this, central
banks can employ several strategies:

1.  Alter money supply
2.  Alter interest rates
3.  Buy or sell securities: when the private sector purchases securities from the
    bank, money is taken out of circulation, and this reduces the demand for
    goods.
