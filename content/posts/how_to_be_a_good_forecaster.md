The following ten commandments are lifted from _Superforecasting_ by Tetlock.

1.  **Triage**: Focus on questions where hard work is likely to pay off.
2.  **Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems**: Perform
    [the fermi estimate]({{< relref "the_fermi_estimate" >}}). Expose and examine assumptions.
3.  **Strike the right balance between inside and outside views**. Nothing is 100%
    unique. See [Outside/Inside View]({{<relref "outside_inside_view.md" >}}).
4.  **Strike the right balance between over and under-reacting to evidence**.
    Bayesian belief updating pays off in the long term. This requires skillful
    processing of news flows.
5.  **Look for clashing causal forces at work in each problem**. List all the
    arguments for and against a point, that are at least worth acknowledging.
6.  **Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits, but
    no more**. Think in more granular ways about uncertainty (going fully
    probabilistic helps).
7.  **Strike the right balance between under and overconfidence, between prudence
    and decisiveness**. Long-term accuracy is dependent on both calibration and
    resolution.
8.  **Look for errors behind your mistakes, but beware of hindsight bias**. Conduct
    postmortems on forecasting failures and successes.
9.  **Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you**.
    Forecasting as a team can bring out the wisdom of a crowd. Let people bring
    in different perspectives, or provide constructive questioning.
10. **Master the error-balancing bicycle**. Getting good at forecasting requires
    deliberate practice, and learning from feedback about whether you are
    succeeding.
