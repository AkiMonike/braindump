In typical encoder-decoder architectectures, the full sentence is
compressed into an output vector by the encoder, which is fed into the
decoder to produce the desired output. The decoder produces outputs
until a special token is received.

It is often unreasonable to expect that the encoder can fully compress
the source sentence into a single vector. Attention mechanisms allow
the decoder to attend to different parts of the source sentence at
each step of the output generation.

The decoder output word \\(y_t\\) now depends on a weighted combination of
all the input states, not just the last state. These attention weights
\\(a\_{t,i}\\) are often normalized to sum to 1.

Attention allows us to visualize what the model is doing, by inspeting
the attention weight matrix.
