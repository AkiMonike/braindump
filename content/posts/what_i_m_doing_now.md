This is a regularly updated log of what I'm currently looking into.

- [High Performance Natural Language Processing]({{< relref "high_performance_natural_language_processing" >}}). The research conducted here is
  part of my day job.
- Working on [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/), as usual. Developmental progress on it has sort of
  stalled. Now that I'm getting back into research, the flaws and things I want
  are starting to show, and I want to sit on my workflow a bit more before
  upgrading Org-roam to fit it better.
- Pruning this digital garden. There are a lot of unnecessary notes. It always
  feels wasteful to delete notes, but I think it will eventually be for the
  best.
- Reading [Optionality]({{< relref "optionality" >}})
