## Background {#background}

In a _machine language_, instructions are encoded as 0's and 1's. This
is unwieldy for programmers to write. Hence, to tell processors what
to execute, programmers use an _assembly language_, writing these
instructions in textual form, for example:

```text
  MOV R9, R3
```

An _assembler_ translates the assembly language into machine language.

There are many machine languages, each designed with a processor in
mind, enabling fast and simple circuits to be built to execute the
instructions. Each machine language requires a corresponding assembly
language, since the assembly language must support a different set of
machine instructions. The design of the machine language encoding is
called the _instruction set architecture (ISA)_.

## Memory Organization {#memory-organization}

- Byte-addressable, 32-bit address space
- little- or big-endian addressable
- 32-bit word length
- word, half-word and byte data transfers to and from processor registers
- word and half-world transfers must be aligned
