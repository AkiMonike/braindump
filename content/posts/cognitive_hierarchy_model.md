See ([Camerer, Ho, and Chong, n.d.](#org8c228c1)) for a nice introduction using Keynes' "beauty
contest" game.

In the cognitive hierarchy model, each player believes that they
understand the game better than other players. Decision rules reflect
an iterative process of strategic thinking.

The CH model consists of iterative decision rules for players doing
\\(k\\) steps of thinking, and the frequency distribution \\(f(k)\\) (assumed
to be Poisson) of step \\(k\\) players.

Step 0 thinkers assume that the other players behave randomly
according to some probability distribution. Step \\(k\\) thinkers assume
that their opponents are distributed according to a normalized Poisson
distribution, from step \\(0\\) to step \\(k-1\\), but ignore the possibility
that some players may be doing as much or more.
