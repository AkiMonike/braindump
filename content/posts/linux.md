- `127.0.1.1` in `/etc/hosts` is to allow some applications like Gnome to
  resolve the hostname to an ip address with a canonical fully
  qualified domain name - FQDN ([Source](http://www.leonardoborda.com/blog/127-0-1-1-ubuntu-debian/))
- `sudo` needs to resolve hostnames because the sudoers file specifies
  hostnames in the rules. Hence sudo requires both loopback and
  "real". ([Source](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/218145/why-does-sudo-need-the-loopback-interface))
- `pkexec` lets authorized users execute programs as another user.
