-   Cycles are not just a series of events in progression: they are often a progression of causative events
-   Cyclical events are influenced by both endogenous events(cyclical events that
    precede them) and exogenous developments (occurring in other areas).
-   A cycle's clout is heightened by the inability of investors to remember the past
-   Cycles are viewed as less symmetrical than they are: the negatives are usually
    exaggerated
