## Kubernetes {#kubernetes}

[Open Containers Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org/)

### Features of a COE {#features-of-a-coe}

1.  clustering
2.  scheduling
3.  scaling
4.  load balancing (pets to cattle)
    - monitoring services vs monitoring
5.  fault tolerance
6.  app deployment

### Why use kubernetes {#why-use-kubernetes}

1.  google
2.  battle hardened
3.  features
4.  open source

### Downsides to kubernetes {#downsides-to-kubernetes}

1.  complex
2.  zero to dev
3.  non-native

| Feature                 | Concept                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Colocation              | Pods                                  |
| Scaling/Fault Tolerance | Replication controllers, replica sets |
| Load Balancing          | Services                              |
| App Deployment          | Rolling-updates                       |

### Architecture {#architecture}

kubectl <--- scheduler (which node is used for container launch etc.)
api server
controllers manager (replication controller etc.)
etcd (service discovery)

MASTER

### Replication controller vs set {#replication-controller-vs-set}

| Controller                 | Set                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| old way                    | new way                       |
| works with rolling updates | supports sets based selectors |
| imperative                 | part of deployments           |
|                            | declarative                   |

### Selectors {#selectors}

eg. I want to select these pods, add it to replication sets

### Kubernetes Schema {#kubernetes-schema}

| Api Version | v1                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Kind        | Pod/ReplicaSet/ReplicaController |
| Metadata    | name/labels                      |
| Spec        | Containers                       |

### Articles on Kubernetes {#articles-on-kubernetes}

<http://www.doxsey.net/blog/kubernetes--the-surprisingly-affordable-platform-for-personal-projects>

Argues that Kubernetes is affordable and worth the try for personal
projects.

The main arguments are:

1.  Kubernetes is reliable and scalable.
2.  It's cheap to run: run HTTP proxy for each node, instead of using
    Google's HTTP load balancer.
3.  Kubernetes makes rollback deployments trivial, since everything is
    containerised.

<http://carlosrdrz.es/kubernetes-for-small-projects/>

A response to the above article. Basically arguing that Kubernetes is
very complex and has a lot of moving parts, which is wholly
unnecessary for side projects.

## Mesos {#mesos}

Mesos is responsible for managing cluster resources (CPU, RAM, disk,
etc) and the allocation of applications into those resources.

[Dominant Resource Fairness](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/drf.pdf)

Two-level scheduler, compared to k8s one-level scheduler.

Scheduler scales a lot better than k8s (earlier).
