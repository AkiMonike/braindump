A spaced repetition repetition system is only as good as its prompts. To
understand what a good prompt entails, it helps to first understand the
operating principles behind a prompt.


## Good prompts invoke retrieval practice {#good-prompts-invoke-retrieval-practice}

When you attempt to retrieve a piece of knowledge, the act of retrieval
reinforces these memories. Improved recall also translates into better
understanding and problem solving abilities&nbsp;[^fn:1].

Effective prompts invoke retrieval practice well. In practice, this comes down
to obeying a few guiding principles:

1.  Prompts should be **focused**, and test one detail at a time.
2.  Prompts should be **precise**, and have explicit, correct answers.
3.  Prompts should be **tractable**, with difficult prompts made easier via cues.
4.  Prompts should be **effortful**, requiring the actual task of retrieval.

[Andy's article](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/) gives a rough guide to creating meaningful prompts on a recipe of
chicken stock, based on different kinds of knowledge.

[Michael Nielsen's article](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) talks about how he uses Anki to do shallow reads of
scientific literature. In summary, he creates Anki flashcards for the key ideas
and contributions of a paper, looking primarily at the abstract, conclusion, and
some of the key figures of the paper.
