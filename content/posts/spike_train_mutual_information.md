Would be nice to compute the mutual information between multi-neuronal spike
trains in [Spiking Neural Networks]({{<relref "spiking_neural_networks.md" >}}). Perhaps we can learn some low-level spike
representation, and relate this somehow to [Information Bottleneck in Deep Neural
Networks]({{<relref "information_bottleneck_dnn.md" >}}).
