## Current Research Trends in Robot Grasping and Bin Picking {#alonso_current_2019}


### [Robot Grasping]({{<relref "robot_grasping.md#" >}}) {#robot-grasping--robot-grasping-dot-md}


### Traditional Bin-picking Approaches {#traditional-bin-picking-approaches}

Most algorithms rely on segmentation of RGB-D data. 3D object recognition is
done by matching 3D data to their known CAD models. [Interactive Closest Point]({{<relref "interactive_closest_point.md#" >}})
can be used to calculate the alignment and best fitting of a cloud of points
with respect to a reference CAD model.

A fast voting scheme similar to the Generalized Hough Transform can be used improving the performance of [ICP]({{<relref "interactive_closest_point.md#" >}}).


### Deep Learning Methodologies for Bin Picking {#deep-learning-methodologies-for-bin-picking}

Deep Learning approaches used RGB-D images as input, and are able to predict
grasp success and generalize to novel objects.
