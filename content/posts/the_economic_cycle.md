-   Currently in long-term secular uptrend because of:
    -   macro environment
    -   corporate growth
    -   the borrowing mentality
    -   popularization of investing
    -   investor psychology

The output of an economy is the product of **hours worked** and **rate of work
done**. These are affected by fundamental factors like birth rate which change
little from year to year.

Factors affecting short-term trend:

-   Willingness to work (market conditions etc.)
-   Fear of spending
-   Amount of wealth: consumers are unlikely to fund consumption by selling stocks or homes

Most economic forecasts are just extrapolations of current trends: they are
usually correct but not valuable. Unconventional forecasts (e.g. predicting
deviations from the long-term trend) are usually incorrect but valuable
