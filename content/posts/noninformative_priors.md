Non-informative priors are used in [Bayesian Inference]({{<relref "bayesian_inference.md#" >}}), in the
situation where no prior information exists, or inference based
dominantly on the data is desired. We wish to find a distribution
\\(p(\theta)\\) that contained "no information" about \\(\theta\\) (favours no
value of \\(\theta\\) over another).

An example of such a non-informative prior in the discrete space would
be a uniform distribution over \\(\theta\\).
