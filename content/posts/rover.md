## Landing a Rover {#landing-a-rover}

Landing on Mars is challenging because there's is too much
atmosphere to be ignored, but too little to cushion the landing.
Hence, all Mars rovers will have a three phrases: Entry, Descent and
Landing (abbrieviated EDL). ([Lakdawalla, n.d.](#org2aedca1))

## How the Curiosity Rover worked {#how-the-curiosity-rover-worked}

-   Lots of redundancy. A-side and B-side electronics.
-   The battery was a [MMRTG battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission%5Fradioisotope%5Fthermoelectric%5Fgenerator). Curiosity used plutonium-238 as the
    nuclear fuel, and an array of thermocouples reliably converted the
    released heat into electricity with no moving parts.

Things to account for:

-   Operating temperatures of each component. Scientists maintained a
    heating table, and also had schedules to ensure that the various
    parts were heated to operating temperature before functioning.
-   Have a system collecting heat output from energy
