Transformer are model architectures that have proven effective across range of
domains such as [Natural Language Processing](../../../../../../Nextcloud/org/braindump/org/nlp.md) and [Computer Vision](../../../../../../Nextcloud/org/braindump/org/computer_vision.md).

These models are identified by the [self-attention mechanism](../../../../../../Nextcloud/org/braindump/org/self_attention.md).
