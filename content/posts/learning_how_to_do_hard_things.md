The key is to isolate one aspect of the problem that is difficult and
work on it. This provides a direct feedback loop.

> 1.  Find something that is like the hard thing but is easy.
> 2.  Modify the easy thing so that it is like the hard thing in exactly one way that you find hard.
> 3.  Do the modified thing until it is no longer hard.
> 4.  If you get stuck, do one of the following:
>     1.  Go back to step 3 and pick a different way in which the problem is hard.
>     2.  Recursively apply the general system for learning to do hard things to the thing you’re stuck on.
>     3.  Go ask an expert or a rubber duck for advice.
>     4.  If you’re still stuck after trying the first three, it’s possible that you may have hit some sort of natural difficulty limit and may not be able to make progress.
> 5.  If the original hard thing is now easy, you’re done. If not, go back to step 2.
