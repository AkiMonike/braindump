A forward contract is a contract between two parties on the delivery of an asset
at a certain time in the future, the maturity of the contract, at a certain
price. This price is fixed at the time the contract is entered. It is a
[financial derivative]({{< relref "financial_derivative" >}}).

these contracts are typically not traded on exchanges, but rather over the
counter, for example between a financial institution and its counterparty. There
is an obligation to fulfill this contract at maturity.
