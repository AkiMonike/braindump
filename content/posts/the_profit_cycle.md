Because the collective sales of all businesses form the GDP, they reflect the
same rate of change as [The Economic Cycle]({{<relref "the_economic_cycle.md#" >}}). However, not all industries are
equally responsive to the economic cycle:

Responsive:

Industrial raw materials and components
: it takes more raw materials (e.g.
    metals, plastic, energy) to expand the GDP

Luxury items
: for example, vacations and trips

Big ticket "durable" items
: for example, cars

Less responsive:

Everyday necessities
: their consumption is less dependent on the status of
    the economy

Low-demand commodities
: for example, clothing

Everyday services
: for example, haircuts, transportation

Leverages also affect a company's profits in response to the economic cycle. This include:

Operating leverage
: the ability to scale up and down (increase sales)
    without increasing costs

Financial leverage
: When the company's capital is sourced via equity or debt
    and require interest payments, a decline in operating profit can cause the net
    income to decline more significantly.
