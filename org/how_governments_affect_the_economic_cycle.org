#+title: How Governments Affect the Economic Cycle

Governments affect the economic cycle by using fiscal tools: i.e. taking and spending.

To stimulate the economy, governments can cut taxes, increase spending, and
distribute stimulus checks, making more money available for spending and
investment.

To slowdown the growth of an economy, governments can increase taxes or cut
spending, reducing the demand in their economies.
