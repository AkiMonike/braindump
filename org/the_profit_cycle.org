#+title: The Profit Cycle

Because the collective sales of all businesses form the GDP, they reflect the
same rate of change as [[id:83ec5164-9a32-4baa-bdb7-c5850c3a0b0c][The Economic Cycle]]. However, not all industries are
equally responsive to the economic cycle:

Responsive:
- Industrial raw materials and components :: it takes more raw materials (e.g.
  metals, plastic, energy) to expand the GDP
- Luxury items :: for example, vacations and trips
- Big ticket "durable" items :: for example, cars

Less responsive:
- Everyday necessities :: their consumption is less dependent on the status of
  the economy
- Low-demand commodities :: for example, clothing
- Everyday services :: for example, haircuts, transportation

Leverages also affect a company's profits in response to the economic cycle. This include:

- Operating leverage :: the ability to scale up and down (increase sales)
  without increasing costs
- Financial leverage :: When the company's capital is sourced via equity or debt
  and require interest payments, a decline in operating profit can cause the net
  income to decline more significantly.
