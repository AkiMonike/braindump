#+title: Writing Good Spaced Repetition Prompts

A spaced repetition repetition system is only as good as its prompts. To
understand what a good prompt entails, it helps to first understand the
operating principles behind a prompt.

* Good prompts invoke retrieval practice

When you attempt to retrieve a piece of knowledge, the act of retrieval
reinforces these memories. Improved recall also translates into better
understanding and problem solving abilities [fn:1].

Effective prompts invoke retrieval practice well. In practice, this comes down
to obeying a few guiding principles:

1. Prompts should be *focused*, and test one detail at a time.
2. Prompts should be *precise*, and have explicit, correct answers.
3. Prompts should be *tractable*, with difficult prompts made easier via cues.
4. Prompts should be *effortful*, requiring the actual task of retrieval.

[[https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/][Andy's article]] gives a rough guide to creating meaningful prompts on a recipe of
chicken stock, based on different kinds of knowledge.

[[http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html][Michael Nielsen's article]] talks about how he uses Anki to do shallow reads of
scientific literature. In summary, he creates Anki flashcards for the key ideas
and contributions of a paper, looking primarily at the abstract, conclusion, and
some of the key figures of the paper.

[fn:1] If the flashcards are numerous and vary enough around a concept, the mind fallsback to a typical problem-solving approach, rather than trying to memorize the answers.
