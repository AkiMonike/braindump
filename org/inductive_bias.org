The incorporation of prior knowledge biases the learning mechanism.
This is also called /inductive bias/. The incorporation of prior
knowledge is inevitable for the success of learning algorithms (the
no-free-lunch theorem). The stronger the prior knowledge that one
starts the learning process with, the easier it is to learn from
further examples.
