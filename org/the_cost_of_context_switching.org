#+title: The Cost of Context Switching

Minimizing context switching is one of the best ways to increase productivity.
I see this phenomenon occur in the systems I implement:

1. [[id:1692864f-0c36-47c1-8d73-91b5fd54d045][Getting Things Done (GTD)]]: Separating the cognitive process into individual
   tasks: e.g. capturing, processing, doing.
2. In Emacs, context switching is minimized by doing everything within Emacs
   itself: writing code, writing notes, reading email. Using Org-mode as the
   glue has been extremely helpful.
3. In building [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/srs.ly][srs.ly]], I consider the importance of ease of prompt creation.
   This reduces context switching: e.g. from reading the article to hopping over
   to Anki and creating flashcards.
