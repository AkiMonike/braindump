#+title: Designing Good Forecasts

Good forecasts must satisfy the following conditions:

1. *The forecast must be unambiguous.* This allows the forecast to be fairly
   evaluated. This also means that the forecast must have a specific deadline.
2. *The forecast must contain a probability estimation*. Since the future is
   inherently uncertain, it is important to also include the notion of
   uncertainty in the predictions.
3. *A forecast can be revised regularly*. A forecaster is allowed to revise
   their forecast regularly. This is especially relevant if certain events
   unfold that can heavily affect the forecast.
