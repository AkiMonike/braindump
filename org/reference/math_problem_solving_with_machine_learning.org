*** Key Idea

Reformulate NLP tasks into entailment tasks. Example inputs:

#+begin_quote
sentence [SEP] It was great
sentence [SEP] It is World news
sentence [SEP] sentence2
#+end_quote

The authors also introduce data augmentations to increase the size of the training data, augmenting existing limited annotated data. Consider one-sentence and two-sentence tasks:
~S1 [SEP] It is CLS~ and ~S1 [SEP] S2~

Positive samples:
- Augment S1 slightly, add ~S1 [SEP] S1'~, or ~S1 [SEP] S2~. Similar for S2.

Negative samples:
- Change S1 drastically, add ~S1 [SEP] S1'~, or ~S1 [SEP] S2~. Similar for S2.
- Randomly sample R1, R2 from different dataset, and add ~R1 [SEP] R2~.
