#+title: How Central Banks Affect the Economic Cycle

Central banks have two main responsibilities in the economy:

1. Controlling inflation
2. Controlling employment rates

These two responsibilities balance each other: when employment rates rise, the
economy grows stronger, resulting in inflation, and vice versa.

Central banks act counter-cyclicly to moderate inflation. To do this, central
banks can employ several strategies:

1. Alter money supply
2. Alter interest rates
3. Buy or sell securities: when the private sector purchases securities from the
   bank, money is taken out of circulation, and this reduces the demand for
   goods.
