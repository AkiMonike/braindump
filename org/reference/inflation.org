#+title: Inflation

- When the demand of goods increases relative to the supply, there can be "demand-pull" inflation.
- When inputs to production such as labour and raw materials increase, there can be "cost-push" inflation.
- When the value of an importing country's currency declines relative to that of
  an exporting country, the cost of the exporter's goods can rise in the
  importing country

Inflation is managed by the [[id:b1449196-777e-4997-a786-d0a41ab761cd][government]] and [[id:3cc65406-58e5-4260-b463-93eef70a7d8e][central banks]].
