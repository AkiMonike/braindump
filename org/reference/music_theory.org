A chord contains the root, third and fifth. A major 7th chord contains the 7th
note in the major scale. The dominant 7th contains the minor 7th note. Minor 7th
chords have a flat 7 and flat 3.

- C major: C, E, G

In the history of music, dominant 7th were used as the 5th, to lead to
somewhere. Jazz and the blues started using the dominant 7th chord everywhere.
