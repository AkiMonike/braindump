#+title: How To Write Good Spaced Repetition Prompts

Good spaced repetition prompts should be:

- Focused :: concentrate on one detail. Having no focus can result in incomplete retrieval.
- Precise :: vague questions elicit vague answers
- Consistent :: the same knowledge should be triggered and recalled for this
  question. Otherwise, this may induce "retrieval-induced forgetting".
- Tractable :: these prompts should almost always be able to be answered correctly
- Effortful :: these prompts should actually involve the act of retrieval, and cannot be infered.

Writing good prompts first require breaking knowledge into discrete components.
