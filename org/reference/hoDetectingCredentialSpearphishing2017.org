#+title: Ho, Sharma, Javed, Paxson, Wagner :: Detecting Credential Spearphishing in Enterprise Settings

The authors designed a detector for credential spearphishing keeping two primary goals in mind:

1. Maintaining a low number of false positives
2. And being able to detect true credential spearphishing attacks

Their detector used two sets of features:

- domain reputation features :: these characterize the likelihood that the employee would visit the URL, given its fully qualified domain
  - How many times the URL has been visited by employees
- sender reputation features :: these characterize whether the sender falls under any of the impersonation models
