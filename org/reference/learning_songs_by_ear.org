1. Find the root on the lowest E string
2. Determine whether it is a major or minor scale
   1. If it is a minor, assume it is the 6th chord (most common in pop music),
      since most minor keys are relative minor and not dorian or phrygian
3. Play the scale, see if base notes fit into the scale
4. Apply chord qualities (1,4,5 major; 2,3,6 minor; 7th diminished)
