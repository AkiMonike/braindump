#+title: Forward Contracts

A forward contract is a contract between two parties on the delivery of an asset
at a certain time in the future, the maturity of the contract, at a certain
price. This price is fixed at the time the contract is entered. It is a
[[id:cdda9422-0b5d-4124-a3f8-02c43b76106e][financial derivative]].

these contracts are typically not traded on exchanges, but rather over the
counter, for example between a financial institution and its counterparty. There
is an obligation to fulfill this contract at maturity.
