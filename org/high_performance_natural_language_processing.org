We need high-performance [[id:4a817202-7d27-43c8-90a7-8417d38c731b][natural language processing]] to scale up NLP systems in
production.

There are several approaches to achieving speeding up NLP systems.

* [[file:knowledge_distillation.org][Knowledge Distillation]]
** TODO DistillBert
** TODO MobileBert

* [[id:c1f7763a-aac4-46ce-ab01-86ee4b29d3cf][Making Transformer Models Efficient]]

* Pruning

Pruning removes "unimportant" weights from a network.
E.g. Prune based on second-order derivatives: "Optimal Brain Damage" and "Optimal Brain Surgeon"
