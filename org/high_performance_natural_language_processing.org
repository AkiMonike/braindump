#+title: High Performance Natural Language Processing


We need high-performance [[id:4a817202-7d27-43c8-90a7-8417d38c731b][natural language processing]] to scale up NLP systems in
production.

There are several approaches to achieving speeding up NLP systems.

* [[id:c84ecd83-ef66-42e9-904a-adb17526e88a][Knowledge Distillation]]
** TODO DistillBert
** TODO MobileBert

* [[id:cb299df5-e052-4a8a-b885-9f749c7d6222][Making Transformer Models Efficient]]

* Pruning

Pruning removes "unimportant" weights from a network.
E.g. Prune based on second-order derivatives: "Optimal Brain Damage" and "Optimal Brain Surgeon"
