Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs) build systems that use [[id:5a6f15fa-e5d4-474e-8ead-56b22d890512][machine learning]]. Machine learning algorithms form just a small part of the system. A ML system at a high-level contains the following components:

- The data used to train the model
- The algorithm behind the model
- The hardware and infrastructure used to serve the model
- The interface (e.g. web/rpc) used to interact with the system

MLEs need to be skilled in all of the above. These correspond to mastery in the following domains:

- Applied Mathematics and Statistics :: a good understanding of [[id:3ec39abc-ea53-4087-8523-7ace154c6aa6][basic probability and statistics]], [[id:3319ef96-2df4-4c7e-98f4-3fc5978bd147][linear algebra]] and calculus should be helpful.
- Computer Science Fundamentals :: knowing your data-structures, algorithms and space-time complexity
- Machine Learning Algorithms :: Knowing what the algorithms are and how to apply them (e.g. Naive Bayes, [[id:a274de6a-d25b-458c-8d25-59f446997849][XGBoost]] etc.)
- Parallel Computing :: How to parallelize expensive tasks
- Data Wrangling :: Preparing, cleaning and transforming data (ETL pipelines e.g. [[id:0fd6c8da-467e-436f-8621-7e3ff5282854][Spark]])
- Data Modelling and Evaluation :: How to evaluate and iterate on models
