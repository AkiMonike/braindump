#+title: Bad Is Stronger Than Good

Losing $100,000 feels much worse than winning the same amount feels good. This
asymmetry was summed up by Roy Baumeister and his colleagues in his paper titled
"Bad Is Stronger Than Good".

This explains why we are adapt quickly to positive events, rather than negative
ones. Lottery winners are often happy for a day or a week, before returning to
their normal levels of happiness.

One implication of this is we should aim to rigorously minimize the risk of
downfall in life, much more so than the pursuit of happiness and all things
positive. Winning is all about not losing.
