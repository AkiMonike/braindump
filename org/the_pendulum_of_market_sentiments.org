#+title: The Pendulum of Market Sentiments

Introduced by Howard Marks in 1991, the mood swings of the securities markets
resemble the movement of a pendulum:

- While the midpoint describes the location of the pendulum on average, it
  spends little time in the middle
- Swinging too far from the middle will result in an inevitable movement in the
  other direction, often far towards the other extreme ([[id:748ec54d-b969-4383-bfd7-1812f2315b84][Regression to the Mean]]
)

Investor psychology often swings quickly between euphoria and depression. The
same goes for securities prices (being overpriced and underpriced).
