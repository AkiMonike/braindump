#+title: The Risk-Return Curve

The higher the risk, the higher the *prospective* return. That is, it makes no
sense to assume more risk if the returns are not going to be higher.

Positive events lead to increased optimizism, which makes people more
risk-tolerant. The increase in risk-tolerance results in lower risk premiums to
be demanded, and this reduction results in lower demanded returns on risky
assets. The price of risky assets rise, making them even riskier (people chasing
momentum stocks).
